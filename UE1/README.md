Welcome to
# Content Management Systems

This is the course in which you learn everything from meeting a client for the first time to deploying a production-ready website. A website which, for obvious reasons, runs on a Content Management System.

(Mastering the contents of this course would enable you to quit your studies and get really rich, which, I hope, you will **not** do. That is, quitting your studies. I have no reservations whatsoever concerning your unlimited  wealth. Be advised, though, that there is a lot of evidence which indicates that more money, once you can easily cover your existential needs, won't make you happy.)
